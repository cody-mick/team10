# Overview

This project was created for the purpose of helping educators find fun ways to
review material. We worked as a team to design a game that is customizable, fun,
and competitive. 

The software is like Who Wants to be a Millionaire TV game show. You quiz one
person or team at a time and see who can get the highest points. The first few 
questions are timed, and then after question 7 the questions get harder so there
is no timer. There are two options for hints (phone a friend and 50/50)
and each team only gets 2 of each hint. 50/50 removes half of the answers to 
narrow down the answer options.
